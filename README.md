## RestedXP (RXP) Speedrun Routes

In addition to the original optimized leveling paths, this fork integrates full RestedXP (RXP) speedrun routes:

- **RestedXP Route Pack**:
  - **Alliance (1-60)**: Custom starting routes for Northshire (Human), Coldridge Valley (Dwarf/Gnome), and Shadowglen (Night Elf), merging into a fully optimized 13-60 speedrun route.
  - **Horde (1-60)**: Custom starting routes for Durotar (Orc/Troll), Mulgore (Tauren), and Tirisfal Glades (Undead), merging into a fully optimized 12-60 speedrun route.

To switch route packs, click the status bar, select **Config**, click the **Route** button, and choose your preferred route pack (Optimized Path, RestedXP).

## Dungeon Selection System (RXP Guides Only)

This fork introduces dungeon selection support integrated directly with the RestedXP (RXP) routes. You can toggle specific dungeons on or off from the options menu:

1. Open the options panel with `/vg` or by clicking the status bar and selecting **Config**.
2. Click the **Dungeons** button next to the Route selector.
3. Toggle the dungeons you plan to run (e.g., Deadmines, Scarlet Monastery, Wailing Caverns).
4. TurtleGuide will automatically recalculate the active guide to include or exclude the dungeon objectives and their prerequisite setups.

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Dungeon steps tagged with `|D|DUNGEONCODE|` are only shown if that dungeon is enabled.
- **Mandatory Override**: Opting into a dungeon automatically forces all associated setup and prerequisite quest steps to be shown as mandatory (ignoring any `#optional` tags in the source guide).
- **Negated Dungeons**: Supports negation tags (e.g., `!DM`) to only show a step if a dungeon is *not* being run.

**Supported Dungeons:**
- RFC (Ragefire Chasm)
- WC (Wailing Caverns)
- DM (Deadmines)
- SFK (Shadowfang Keep)
- BFD (Blackfathom Deeps)
- STOCKADES (The Stockade)
- GNOMER (Gnomeregan)
- RFK (Razorfen Kraul)
- SM (Scarlet Monastery)
- RFD (Razorfen Downs)
- ULDA (Uldaman)
- ZF (Zul'Farrak)
- MARA (Maraudon)
- ST (Sunken Temple)
- BRD (Blackrock Depths)

## How It Works

### The Status Bar

When you log in, a small status bar appears near your quest tracker showing your current objective:

```
[✓] [<] [icon] [15/120] Kill 8 Grell Earring [?] [>]
 │    │    │       │              │            │   │
 │    │    │       │              │            │   └─ Next: Skip to next objective
 │    │    │       │              │            └─ [?] indicates there's a note (hover for details)
 │    │    │       │              └─ The objective description
 │    │    │       └─ Step number / Total steps in current guide
 │    │    └─ Icon shows objective type (see below)
 │    └─ Prev: Go back to previous objective
 └─ Checkbox: Mark complete when checked
```

**Click the status bar** to open the full objectives panel with more details.

### Reading Objectives

Each objective has an **action type** shown by its icon:

| Icon | Code | Action | Meaning |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 📜 | A | ACCEPT | Pick up a quest from an NPC |
| ⚔️ | C | COMPLETE | Do the quest objectives (kill, collect, etc.) |
| 📜 | T | TURNIN | Turn in a completed quest |
| 🏃 | R | RUN | Travel to a location |
| 🦅 | F | FLY | Take a flight path |
| 🦅 | f | GETFLIGHTPOINT | Discover a new flight path |
| 🏠 | H | HEARTH | Use your hearthstone |
| 🏠 | h | SETHEARTH | Set your hearthstone location |
| ⛵ | b | BOAT | Take a boat or zeppelin |
| 💀 | K | KILL | Grind mobs (not for a quest) |
| 📝 | N | NOTE | Important information or tip |
| 🛒 | B | BUY | Purchase items from a vendor |
| 📦 | U | USE | Use an item |
| 📖 | t | TRAIN | Visit a class trainer |

**Objective tags** in the panel:
- **(Optional)** - Can be skipped without breaking the guide
- **[?]** - Has additional notes (hover to see)
- Orange text on the right shows quest progress or notes

### Navigating the Guide

**Automatic progression:**
- The addon tracks your quest log and automatically advances when you accept, complete, or turn in quests
- Travel objectives (RUN, FLY, BOAT) auto-complete when you arrive at the destination (if TomTom is installed)

**Manual navigation:**
- **< / >** buttons: Move backward/forward one step
- **>>** button: Mark current step complete and advance
- **Checkboxes**: Click to manually mark any step complete/incomplete
- `/vg next` / `/vg prev`: Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- `/vg goto 50`: Jump directly to step 50

**Smart skip on guide load:**
- When loading a guide, TurtleGuide scans your quest log and automatically skips to where you left off
- If you have quests in progress, it finds the right step

### The Branch System

The **Branch** feature lets you temporarily leave the optimized path to do other content:

1. Click **Branch** in the objectives panel
2. Select any zone guide (TurtleWoW zones, vanilla zones, etc.)
3. Complete as much as you want
4. Click **Return Main** to go back

**When you return:**
- TurtleGuide finds the appropriate step in the optimized path based on your level
- Your progress in the branch is saved if you want to return later
- A green `[Branch]` indicator shows when you're off the main path

**Example workflow:**
```
Level 35, doing Joana's route in Stranglethorn Vale
  ↓
Branch to Gilneas (TurtleWoW zone) for custom content
  ↓
Do some quests, get to level 37
  ↓
Click "Return Main" → Resumes at level 37 section of optimized path
```
